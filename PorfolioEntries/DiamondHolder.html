				<p>
					A researcher was shooting electrons at a doped diamond and wanted to have 4 different sections in the diamond that have been exposed to electrons for different amounts of time or at different strengths.  
				</p>
				<p>
					This was a particularly difficult job as the diamond was only 2 x 2 mm and the holder had to extend upwards into the machine through a 5 mm diameter hole. The holder also had to be made out of metal so it could be grounded, as there was a risk of the material melting/burning due to being hit by high speed electrons.
				</p>
				<p>
					I designed a 3 part holder that consisted of a base plate, stem, and cap. The stem would be secured into the base plate with a screw and the cap would sit on top of the stem with notches to precisely cover half the diamond and then index in 90 degree rotations.
				</p>
				<p>
					The cap and the stem were first turned on the lathe and then the diamond notch on the stem was machined on a CNC. The slot on the cap was manually machined.
